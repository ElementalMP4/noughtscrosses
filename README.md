# Object-oriented Noughts and Crosses
I built this version of n*n noughts and crosses in the second week of learning Java as part of A-level Computer Science. All the object oriented stuff is self taught as we haven't actually covered that yet in class... but I knew how OOP works anyway. `Main.java` is the file to run to start the game. Each player can be either a human or randomised computer, I might add other options (possibly network, or better AI) later. Hope you enjoy! (I like setting it to 10x10 and watching two random number generators battle it out!)
